Your original file is never altered, and you can run the tool again with different settings as often as you like.`,
      `The three modes suit different jobs. Ranges mode takes groups written the way you would in a print dialog, for example 1-3, 4-6, 7, and turns each comma-separated group into its own file. Every N pages mode slices the document into equal parts, and the last file simply holds whatever pages remain. The every-page mode gives one PDF per page. Ranges may overlap, so a page listed in two groups is copied into both files. Keep your ranges inside the document's page count.`,
      `People split PDFs to share only what is needed. A scanned book can become one file per chapter. A signed page can be pulled out of a long contract. HR teams break a combined payslip run into one file per employee, so each person receives only their own.

You choose between three levels. The gentlest keeps your text exactly as it is. The stronger two trade text selectability for a much smaller file. Compare the size of the result with your original before you decide which one to use.`,
      `Low mode rewrites the file's internal structure and packs its objects more efficiently without touching text, fonts or images. It is lossless, but the saving depends on how wastefully the file was written, and files that are already optimized may barely shrink. Medium and high modes work differently: each page is rendered in your browser and saved as a compressed JPEG inside a new PDF. That can cut scanned and photo-heavy documents dramatically, but the text on those pages becomes part of the picture, so it can no longer be selected, copied or searched.`,
      `Compression helps most with scans and documents full of photographs, which are large because of their images. Typical cases are a scanned contract that exceeds a ten megabyte upload limit, a brochure exported from a design tool at print resolution that is going onto a website, or a bundle of statements for a government portal with a strict size cap. Text-only documents are already small, so compressing them achieves little.`,
