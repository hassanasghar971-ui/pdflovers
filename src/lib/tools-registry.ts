    how: `Rotation is stored as a page property rather than by redrawing the content, so text, images and quality are untouched. The turn you choose is added to any rotation the page already has, which means repeating the tool keeps turning it further.`,
    uses: `It is handy after scanning a stack of paper where a few sheets went through the feeder sideways, when a landscape table sits on a portrait report, or when a phone camera app saved receipts with the wrong orientation.`,

    how: `The tool sets the page crop and trim boxes to the smaller area, which is what viewers use to decide what to show. The original content is not deleted, only hidden, so the file size usually stays about the same.`,
    uses: `Remove black scanner edges, cut away headers and footers before presenting a slide, make a wide-margin article fit a small screen better, or tighten up a diagram so it can be dropped into a document.`,
    tip: `Because cropping only hides content, do not use it to remove confidential material. Use the redact tool with rasterizing for that. Keep percentages modest, since each side can remove at most 45 percent.`,
    faq: [
      [`Does cropping permanently delete the outside area?`, `No. The area is hidden by the page boxes. Someone with PDF editing software could restore it, so never rely on cropping for secrecy.`],

    how: `Low mode rewrites the file structure and packs objects more efficiently without touching content. Medium and high render each page and save it as a compressed JPEG inside a new PDF, trading text selectability for size.`,

    how: `First the tool tries to reload and re-save the document with its structure rebuilt. If that fails, it falls back to rendering whatever pages can still be read and assembling them into a new PDF made of page images.`,
